# Item Tracker Application
Final project of the Fall 2021 - Programming III course. Written in collaboration with [Jeremy Oroc](https://github.com/JeremyOroc) and [Julian Hernandez](https://github.com/Julian-Hernandez1). 

We designed an inventory tracker for grocery stores to keep track of all their inventory and allow them to modify each item’s properties. It provides multiple functionalities such as increase, decrease an item’s quantity through buttons, delete and add an item as well as clear an inventory. The increase, decrease, delete and edit buttons only work if an item is selected and clear will remove all items from the main window if there are any. Furthermore, the application provides the functionality of generating a complete and detailed report of all items and generating a shopping list which when selected will show all items that need to be purchased if an item’s available quantity is less than its minimum quantity. The edit button allows the user to modify all item’s properties. The user can also load data from a CSV file as well as save data to a CSV file. Moreover, if the user has loaded a file and has changed it, the program will ask the user if they want to save the changes when they want to either load another file or exit the program. Finally there is a status bar at the bottom of the window to show the user where their file that they are using or saving is located.
